<b> Hospital Management System </b>

<p>This is a console-based Hospital Management System built entirely in Java. The program simulates the operations of a hospital, providing essential information about its services, facilities, staff, infrastructure, and availability. It also allows users to book appointments based on their satisfaction with the information provided.</p>

<b>Features :</b>
<ul>
<li>Hospital Information: Comprehensive details about services, facilities, hospital staff (doctors and nurses), infrastructure, available ambulances, and ICU room availability.</li>
<li>Staff Management: Information about doctors, nurses, and patients is managed efficiently using data structures.</li>
<li>Appointment Booking: Users can confirm appointments through a queue-based system after reviewing hospital details.</li>
<li>Ambulance Management: Ambulance data is stored in a stack, ensuring the last-arrived ambulance is dispatched first, simulating a structured parking system.</li>
<li>Internship/Practical Applications: Students or individuals applying for internships or practicals can register their details, which are stored in an array.</li>
</ul>

<b>Data Structure Usage :</b>
<ul>
<li>Linked List: Used to manage and store detailed information about doctors, nurses, and patients.</li>
<li>Stack: Manages ambulance data, adhering to a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure for dispatch.</li>
<li>Queue: Implements a First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) system for patient appointment scheduling.</li>
<li>Array: Stores data for individuals applying for internships or practical training at the hospital.</li>
</ul>
This project showcases efficient use of core Java concepts and data structures to solve real-world problems in a hospital management setting.
